I will upload one or more PowerPoint presentations (.pptx) on sociology-related topics such as politics, education, religion, consumption, postmodernity, and social theory.

I want you to:

    Extract and organize relevant information from the slides.

    Match that information to the following themes and questions.

    If the content needed is not found in the slides, just say so and move on to the next theme.
